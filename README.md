 <h1> Mino's Go-To Caffeinated Drinks </h1>
  <p> In this site, you will see my preferred drinks for an extra boost of energy on the days where I just can NOT handle it anymore </p>
  <p> While I prefer some drinks over others, these will be in no specific order other than grouping by brand and/or type of drink. </p>

 <h2> Starbucks's Iced Chai Tea Latte </h2>
  <p> Chai Tea originates from India and is originally called "Masala Chai". The tea was first made by boiling black tea with milk, water, herbs, and spices. However, at Starbucks it's a syrup put in by the pump. I typically get this with oatmilk for the sake of my stomache, but I'm sure it tastes good with other types as well. While this list isn't entirely ranked, this is my absolute go-to for caffeine as it has zero aftertaste unlike coffee-based caffeines or energy drinks. </p>

 <h2> Starbucks's Iced Chocolate Almond Milk Shaken Espresso (Yes that is it's actual name) </h2>
<p> Chocolate syrup, almond milk, and espresso, surprisingly doesn't have the coffee aftertaste that I am extremely picky about. I typically get this when I have my 30 minute breaks at work for a small pick-me-up. Plus, who doesn't love some chocolatey goodness? </p>

 <h2> Starbucks's Iced Blonde Vanilla Latte </h2>
  <p> I always get extra vanilla because it's just better the less it tastes like coffee! This drink is probably one of my original favorites from starbucks, I've been getting it since quarantine. Like the Iced Chai Tea Latte, I also get this with oatmilk, but it tastes good with regular milk as well! </p>

 <h2> Bang Energy Drink - 'Blue Razz' </h2>
  <p> The Blue Razz is one of my favorites due to the nostalgia flavor of the fictional blue raspberry. Whether it's a candy or drink, when done right, Blue Raspberry flavored things have a place in my heart.  </p>

 <h2> Bang Energy Drink - 'Cotton Candy' </h2>
  <p> The Cotton Candy flavor is truly for someone with a sweet tooth. It quite seriously tastes like sugary cotton candy, or at least just a sweet actual candy. </p>

 <h2> Bang Energy Drink - 'Sour Heads' </h2>
  <p> My absolute favorite drink after the Iced Chai Tea Latte. It has the flavoring of sour candy with little-to-no bad aftertaste. On occasion I stock up around 4 or 5 cans at a time to prepare for hard days that I know I'll need caffeine to get me through. The sour apple mixed with the slight sweetness is such a great pick-me-up for early morning activities. </p>
